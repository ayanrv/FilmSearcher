# FilmSearcher

---Overview:
I have developed a mini project (This is more of an outline than a finished project) that leverages modern web technologies to create a dynamic and interactive movie app. This app allows users to search for films and receive suggestions based on their input, view film posters, create and manage lists of films, and review the contents of their lists in a separate window.

---Technologies Used:

- React: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allows for a responsive and dynamic experience.

- React DOM: Utilized to manage the rendering of the React components and handle DOM manipulation efficiently.

- Babel: Babel is employed for JavaScript transpilation, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and environments.

- React Router: This library is used to handle navigation and routing within the app, providing seamless transitions between different views.

- Redux: The app uses Redux for state management, allowing efficient data flow and synchronization between components.

- IMDB API: By integrating the IMDB API, the app can fetch film data, including suggestions and film posters, based on the user's search queries.


---Features:

- Search Films: Users can search for films by inputting keywords, and the app provides suggestions based on the IMDB API.

- View Film Details: Users can view film posters.

- Create and Manage Lists: Users can create custom lists of films, add films to these lists, and delete them as needed.

- Review Lists: Users can view the contents of their lists in a separate view, providing easy access to their favorite movies.


---Skills Highlighted:

- Web Development: Proficiency in modern web technologies such as React, Babel, and Redux.

- API Integration: Experience in working with external APIs like IMDB to fetch and display data dynamically.

- State Management: Efficiently managing app state using Redux for optimal performance.

- Routing: Navigating between different views seamlessly using React Router.

- User Interface Design: Creating a responsive and intuitive user interface with React and related technologies.
